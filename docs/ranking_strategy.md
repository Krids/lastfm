## 🎯 **Business Requirements & Success Criteria**

### **Primary Objective**
Transform session analysis data (Gold layer) into the final ranked output identifying the **top 10 most popular songs from the top 50 longest sessions** by track count.

### **Core Business Requirements**
- ✅ Identify the **top 50 longest sessions** from all user sessions (ranked by track count)

- ✅ Count track occurrences across all selected sessions
- ✅ Generate **top 10 most frequently played tracks**
- ✅ Output results in **tab-separated values (TSV) format**
- ✅ Handle ties in rankings consistently and deterministically

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Generate `top_songs.tsv` with exactly 10 songs (or fewer if insufficient data)
- ✅ Maintain **100% test coverage** on ranking logic
- ✅ Follow established **hexagonal architecture** patterns
- ✅ Process data efficiently with **strategic caching**
- ✅ Complete pipeline execution in **< 3 minutes** for full dataset

**Key Requirements**:
- Immutable value object with ranking position
- Track count as primary ranking criterion
- Session duration as secondary criterion
- User identifier for tie-breaking
- Complete track list for aggregation
- Validation of ranking consistency

#### **TrackPopularity Domain Model**
**Purpose**: Represent track play statistics across selected sessions.

**Key Requirements**:
- Track identification (name + artist)
- Total play count across sessions
- Number of unique sessions containing track
- Number of unique users who played track
- Ranking position in final list
- Immutable with validation

#### **RankingResult Domain Model**
**Purpose**: Aggregate final ranking results with metadata and quality metrics.

**Key Requirements**:

2. Group tracks by composite key (artist + track name)
3. Count total occurrences
4. Count unique sessions per track
5. Count unique users per track
6. Handle track identity variations
```

#### **TopSongsSelector**
**Purpose**: Select and rank top songs by popularity.

4. **Extreme Imbalance**: One session with 10K tracks, others with <10
5. **Circular References**: Same track appearing in all top sessions
6. **Data Skew**: 90% of plays concentrated in 1% of tracks

### **Track Aggregation Edge Cases**

1. **Name Variations**: "Song" vs "Song (Remastered)" vs "Song - Live"
2. **Artist Collaborations**: "Artist A feat. Artist B" vs "Artist A & Artist B"

4. **Case Sensitivity**: "SONG" vs "Song" vs "song"
5. **Whitespace Issues**: Leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces
6. **Empty Fields**: Tracks with missing artist or title information

### **Output Generation Edge Cases**

### **Data Quality Edge Cases**

1. **Incomplete Sessions**: Sessions missing track information
2. **Corrupt Metadata**: Unparseable or invalid session data
3. **Time Paradoxes**: Sessions with end time before start time
4. **Duplicate Sessions**: Same session ID appearing multiple times
