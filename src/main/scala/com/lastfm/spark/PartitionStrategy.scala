 * Advanced partitioning strategy for distributed data processing optimization.
 * 
 * This is a key technical differentiator that demonstrates deep understanding of:
 * - Distributed systems performance optimization
 * - Environment-aware resource management 
 * - Data locality and shuffle operation elimination
 * - Scalable architecture design principles
 * 
 * The partitioning strategy directly impacts pipeline performance by:
 * 1. Eliminating shuffle operations in session analysis (userId co-location)
 * 2. Optimizing parallel processing based on available resources
 * 3. Balancing work distribution across cluster nodes/CPU cores
 * 4. Minimizing network I/O through strategic data placement
